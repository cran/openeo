\title{Connect to a openEO service}
\usage{
connect(host, version = NULL, exchange_token = "access_token", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{host}{URL pointing to the openEO server service host}

\item{version}{the openEO API version number as string (optional), see also \code{\link{api_versions}}}

\item{exchange_token}{'access_token' or 'id_token' defines in the OIDC case the bearer token use}

\item{...}{parameters that are passed on to \code{\link{login}}}
}
\description{
Connects to openEO service. If the back-end provides a well-known endpoint that allows redirecting to
specific versions you should provide the version parameter.
}
\details{
You can explore several already available openEO web services by using the openEO hub (\url{https://hub.openeo.org/}). There you 
have an overview about their status and connection details like the URL and supported features. You can explore the
service for free through the access to publicly available metadata of data collections as well as the offered
processing functions. For any computation and the creation of web services, you need to register the openEO partner of
your choice. There you will get further information on credentials and the log in procedure.

The \code{...} parameter allows you to pass on arguments directly for \code{\link{login}}. If they are omitted the 
client will only connect to the back-end, but does not do authentication. The user must do that manually afterwards. 
Based on the provided login parameters user / password or OIDC provider the appropriate login procedure for basic authentication
or OIDC authentication will be chosen.

The parameter \code{version} is not required. If the service offers a well-known document of the
service the client will choose an appropriate version (default the most recent production ready version).

When calling this function the \code{\link{OpenEOClient}} is also stored in a variable in the package
which marks the latest service that was connected to.

# The following examples show different configuration settings and point

# register with one of the provider if required.

# connect to a host of the latest version and without authentication

# connect to a host by direct URL and basic log in

             password='password')

# connect to a host with open id connect authentication
con = connect(host='http://example.openeo.org')

# connect and login with a named and valid oidc provider
