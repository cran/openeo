\title{Get a process graph builder / process collection from the connection}
\usage{
processes(con = NULL)

active_process_collection(processes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{con}{a connection to an openEO back-end (optional) otherwise \code{\link[=active_connection]{active_connection()}}
is used.}

\item{processes}{the \code{\link{ProcessCollection}} that is obtained from \code{processes()} to be set as the active process collection or left empty to fetch the \code{ProcessCollection} from the package variable.}
}
\value{
a \code{\link{ProcessCollection}} object with the offered processes of the back-end
}
\description{
Queries the connected back-end for all available processes and collection names and registers them via R functions on
a \code{\link{ProcessCollection}} object to build a process graph in R. The current \code{\link{ProcessCollection}} is stored internally at the package environment
variable \code{process_collection}, which can be fetched and set with \code{active_process_collection}.
