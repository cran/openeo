\details{
The parameter \code{submit} will be deprecated in the future. Please use \code{as(obj, "Process")}.
This function is useful when copying a JSON representation of your process graph to
another software. In that case use \code{udp = as(obj, "Process")} and simply print or call 
object \code{udp} on the console.
