\description{
List available collections stored on an openEO server and return them as a \code{CollectionList} - a named list of \code{Collection} objects.
The names are the collection IDs. Although the result at \code{\link[=describe_collection]{describe_collection()}} is also a Collection, the Collection object of returned
from \code{list_collections()} is considered a list entry with less detailed information. The collection list is stored internally as the package
environment variable \code{data_collection}, which can be accessed and set with \code{active_data_collection()}.
