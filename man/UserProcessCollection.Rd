\title{User Defined Process Collection}
\description{
This object contains template functions from the users stored user defined processes (UDP), which can be reused in other process graphs.
}
\details{
This object is an unlocked R6 object, that allows us to add new functions to this object at runtime. It is structured in the same way 
as the \code{\link{ProcessCollection}} for predefined processes by the openEO back-end. A \code{\link{UserProcessCollection}} is usually created at 
\code{\link{user_processes}}. If you have submitted new user defined processes to the back-end, make sure to call \code{\link{user_processes}} again
to fetch the latest status.
