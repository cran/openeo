<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Software and Package Architecture</h1>



<p>This R package is a client in terms of the <a href="https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/developers/arch.html">openEO
architecture</a>. This sets the aim of the package to make openEO
back-ends with their Earth Observation data collections (EO collections)
and functions available to the R community. As described in the <a href="https://api.openeo.org">openEO API</a> the clients communicate
with the back-end via RESTful HTTP calls in order to exchange JSON
objects which mostly contains meta data about collections, processes,
jobs or process graphs.</p>
<p>You can only obtain actual data by downloading processed results as
files. But for development and testing purposes subsets of immediate
results can be directly imported into R as stars objects. Other than
that, the processing is done remotely on the back-end and the developed
functions in R will aid to visualize and manage the data and service
exploration and the creation of processing workflows.</p>
<p>This means that ultimately each call in R will be translated into a
corresponding JSON representation and/or HTTP call and vice versa.</p>
<p>In the following topics we will briefly state what requirements can
be derived by using the openEO API and how those requirements influenced
the design choices of the package.</p>
<div id="api" class="section level1">
<h1>API</h1>
<p>We will not dive to deep into this topic, because the openEO API is
very well-documented and covers every aspect about the intended
communication between clients and openEO back-ends.</p>
<p>Those well-defined endpoints with their parameters are templated and
stored as internal CSV files of this package (see
/inst/extdata/api_xxx.csv). This files are loaded during the
“connection” to an openEO back-end and used as a lookup table to map the
static functions of the “openeo” package like list_collections(),
create_job() or compute_results() to their HTTP counterparts including
the naming of the parameters.</p>
<p>When I speak about static functions in this context, I mean those
functions that interact with the openEO back-end via the endpoints
defined in the openEO API. The reason for this is that those functions
are binding to an openEO conformant back-end and need to be implemented
in order to allow successful communication and data processing from any
openEO client.</p>
<p>In two ways there are dynamic aspects to this. First, the back-end
provider can choose which components are implemented and made available
for a user, which needs to be checked during the connection phase. The
second dynamic aspect is the whole topic about process graph building.
With <a href="https://processes.openeo.org/">openEO processes</a> there
is a set of processes published that aim to processes EO data where the
data is abstracted into an n-dimensional data cube (see <a href="https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/datacubes.html">openEO data
cubes</a> or <a href="https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/"><code>stars</code>
vignettes</a> for relateable context). The openEO API defines an
endpoint that lists all actually supported processes by the back-end for
process graph building. The processes come also as JSON objects that
contain descriptive meta data about the processes itself as well as the
name and types of arguments for those processes. Those self-describing
processes allow the openEO back-end to use the predefined openEO
processes, but they can change the naming, the allowed types or invent
completely new processes.</p>
<p>This flexibility requires from this R package that the processes for
process graph building cannot be provided as static R function of this
package, but have to be read and interpreted dynamically at runtime in
order to make it compatible between different openEO back-ends.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-package-dependencies" class="section level1">
<h1>R package dependencies</h1>
<p>So, there are several package dependencies from this package, which
will be discussed briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li>httr2</li>
<li>jsonlite</li>
<li>sf</li>
<li>R6</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the major packages, we use also other packages like
IRdisplay and htmltools. Those are imported for visualization purposes
for a seamless integration of the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openeo/vue-components">openEO Vue
components</a> for a general look and feel in interactive R reporting
environments like R markdown / notebook as well, as Jupyter notebooks
with an R Kernel.</p>
<div id="httr2" class="section level2">
<h2>httr2</h2>
<p>As stated in the beginning the openEO architecture requires back-ends
to expose their functionalities via RESTful HTTP endpoints. So the
client needs tools for that purpose which are provided by the httr2
package. Earlier versions used the package httr, but httr2 was chosen
over the latter, because it offered more authentication methods (for
example the “OAuth2 device code flow”).</p>
</div>
<div id="jsonlite" class="section level2">
<h2>jsonlite</h2>
<p>Also for communication purpose jsonlite was chosen to serialize the
objects into JSON.</p>
</div>
<div id="sf" class="section level2">
<h2>sf</h2>
<p>For geospatial reasons we use sf as main package for spatial vector
data. It is established, widely used and well-known by users. Inside the
package it handles the translation between geospatial objects in R and
GeoJSON.</p>
</div>
<div id="r6" class="section level2">
<h2>R6</h2>
<p>R6 is an object oriented programming style like S3 or S4 in R that is
based on <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Environments.html">R
environments</a>, which can be referenced by an address pointer. This
makes them reusable and a solid choice when it comes to realize
configurable graphs in R, which we will want to achieve in “openeo” in
order to create the process workflows for the openEO back-end in order
to manipulate EO data. During the creation of those graphs we might
reuse the result of a prior process in multiple following processes.
Objects in S3 and S4 create hard copies of itself, if passed to other
functions, whereas an R6 object will always reference to the same
entity. Just this feature will allow process parameter to be easily
changed after it is created. This means, we will use R6 objects when it
comes to dynamic data, e.g. process graph building and connection
handling. Mere meta data representation as obtained from the JSON
objects will be handled as S3 objects.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="authentication" class="section level1">
<h1>Authentication</h1>
<p>To get access to the computation capabilities and user stored data
openEO you need to be a registered user at the openEO back-end, where
you want to carry out your analysis. In order to proof that to the
system you need to be authenticated. The openEO API offers Open ID
Connect (OIDC) and Basic Authentication as authentication methods. In
this package the we use primarily OIDC, but also offer Basic
Authentication for legacy support. As OIDC is based on OAuth2 there are
several different sub mechanisms, e.g. Authcode Flow or Device Code Flow
with or without PKCE. The mechanisms are covered by the httr2 package
<code>httr2::oauth_flow_device()</code>, which is used to negotiate the
authentication and to obtain the required access token. In the code the
different authentication methods are realized by the different R6
classes that share a common interface <code>IAuth</code>. Inheriting
classes implement and overload those functions so that by using the
function <code>..$login()</code> or the active field access_token all
objects behave in the same manor and ultimately provide the access
token.</p>
</div>
<div id="visual-components" class="section level1">
<h1>Visual Components</h1>
<p>The openEO Team has released <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openeo/vue-components/v/2.0.0">Vue
components for openEO</a> which is a JavaScript library combined with
some CSS files. Those components visualize static objects like
collections, processes and jobs in a unified way. This generates a
general Look and Feel throughout different openEO clients as the <a href="https://editor.openeo.org/">openEO Web Editor</a> and the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/openeo/">openEO Python client</a> uses
those components too. In this package the
<code>collection_viewer()</code> or <code>process_viewer()</code> can be
used to open those HTML templates spiked with the actual data to be
visualized. Further more, the Vue components are rendered when the
respective objects are printed in R managed HTML environments like
R-Markdown or R-Notebook (even Jupyter Notebook with an R Kernel).</p>
</div>
<div id="print-behavior-coercion-and-s3" class="section level1">
<h1>Print Behavior, Coercion and S3</h1>
<p>The JSON objects that are returned at various openEO API endpoints
are internally tagged as S3 objects like
<code>class(object) = &quot;SomeClass&quot;</code>, where object is a list object
that was translated from JSON with jsonlite functions and “SomeClass”
being a used S3 class of the “openeo” package. For those classes we have
defined a different print behavior for the prior list objects. This is
especially the case for the table like objects on the static
<code>list_xxx()</code> functions. Before printing those R lists are
coerced with <code>as.data.frame()</code> functions before printing to
console. But the original object is not changed. If tables shall be
created for those lists, then they need to be coerced manually.</p>
<p>See <code>openeo::as.data.frame()</code> and
<code>/R/print-functions.R</code> for further information.</p>
</div>
<div id="process-graph-building" class="section level1">
<h1>Process Graph Building</h1>
<p>We will dedicate a separate vignette on this topic, where we will
explain the concepts involved on parsing the process definitions and
creating typed input parameters for validation. For now, the openEO API
defines how processes are defined as JSON object. Conceptually those
processes consist of general metadata like description and examples and
parameters, which are used to control the process. All those parameters
allow different types of data, so we need to somehow circumvent R’s type
free assignment of variables by defining mechanisms to type checking and
validation.</p>
